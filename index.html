          <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Angel Rodriguez, a senior Engineering Technology student at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, graduating in Fall 2025. My academic and professional experiences have led me to develop a strong interest in control systems engineering and related technologies.</p>

      <p>Most recently, I completed a Lean Six Sigma internship with the quality team at Saint-Gobain Abrasives, where I gained valuable exposure to process improvement and industrial operations. I'm currently working on my senior design project: designing and developing a 3DOF quadcopter platform to support undergraduate control systems education.</p>

      <p>Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on projects and coursework involving PLCs, CNC machines, CAD design, and general electronics. Classes like Industrial Electronics, Motors and Transformers, and Instruments and Transducers have given me a strong foundation in practical systems and components used in automation and control.</p>

      <h3>Continuing Education</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Applying PID control strategies in MATLAB/Simulink for real-time systems</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience with microcontrollers and Arduino integration</li>
        <li>Designing and fabricating parts using 3D CAD and additive manufacturing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Electronics Projects:</strong> I enjoy building small systems and experimenting with embedded hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy Gaming:</strong> I’m a fan of games that challenge planning, systems thinking, and problem-solving.</li>
        <li><strong>Design & Creativity:</strong> I like visualizing ideas through 3D modeling and schematic design.</li>

    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Project Maverick! My name is Angel Rodriguez and I will be working on this project during the Spring and Fall 2025 semesters. The goal of this project is to design and develop a low-cost workbench to implement different control strategies for a 3 DoF UAV. I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="internal-section" id="problem-mav">
    <h3>What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?</h3>
    <p>Existing quadcopter test stands are expensive and inaccessible to many universities. This limits hands-on learning opportunities for students. Our goal is to create a workbench where students can implement their own control strategies and get real experience with systems involving sensors, actuators, and embedded controllers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="internal-section" id="background-mav">
    <h3>Important to Know</h3>
    <p>Before diving into our solution, it's important to understand a few key concepts behind quadcopter control and test stand design.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3 Degrees of Freedom (3DOF):</strong> Our system is designed to allow motion in roll, pitch, and yaw while restricting translational movement.</li>
      <li><strong>PID Controllers:</strong> Control is achieved using a PID algorithm modeled in Simulink and deployed in real-time.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor Feedback Loop:</strong> The Arduino collects data from an IMU and sends it to the controller in Simulink.</li>
      <li><strong>ESC & PWM Control:</strong> The Arduino Mega determines motor speeds via PWM signals to the ESCs.</li>
      <li><strong>Educational Focus:</strong> The platform is modular, safe, and low-cost, with mostly 3D printed components to support classroom use.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="internal-section" id="whyimportant-mav">
    <h3>Why This Problem Is Important</h3>
    <p>Students often struggle to bridge the gap between theory and practice in control systems courses. This project gives them hands-on access to tune, test, and validate control strategies on a real system.</p>
    <p>Traditional drones are often closed-source, expensive, or too risky to use in classrooms. Our design addresses all of these barriers by focusing on safety, openness, and affordability.</p>
    <p>According to the National Training Laboratories, students retain 75% of what they do — compared to only 10% of what they read. Research also shows improved outcomes when control theory is applied in lab-based environments (IEEE, 2017).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="internal-section" id="solution-mav">
    <h3>Our Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>We developed a low-cost, open-source quadcopter test stand that allows motion in three rotational degrees of freedom. It is ideal for teaching students about control systems using real hardware and real-time models.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3DOF Stand:</strong> Allows visible and measurable rotational movement for roll, pitch, and yaw.</li>
      <li><strong>Simulink PID Control:</strong> Control logic is modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink.</li>
      <li><strong>Arduino Mega:</strong> Acts as the onboard controller handling PWM and sensor communication.</li>
      <li><strong>3D Printed Frame:</strong> Most parts are designed in CAD and printed to reduce cost and allow flexibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This system gives students an intuitive, hands-on way to see how control theory operates in real time — from model to motion.</p>

  <div class="internal-section" id="prototype-mav">
    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
    <p>To validate our design before manufacturing, I created a 3D model of the 3DOF quadcopter stand using CAD software. This allowed me to test for fit, mechanical clearance, and mounting points. The 3D model will be used to 3D print key components such as motor brackets, arm mounts, and sensor enclosure. These parts will be assembled into a physical prototype to evaluate stability, weight distribution, and accessibility of electrical connections.</p>
    <p> This hands-on prototype stage helped identify practical challenges like wire routing, center-of-mass offset, and sensor noise due to vibrations. It will also give us the opportunity to test motor response and refine our Simulink controller with a physical system in the loop.</p>

    <h3>Final Product</h3>
    <p>This project is still under development and will be updated as it goes along with intent to finish the project before the end of the Fall 2025 semester </p>
  </div>

  <div class="internal-section" id="future-mav">
    <h3>Future Work</h3>
    <p>The Maverick project is still far from being completed as of right now. In the coming future, I plan on receiving the electrical components and begin assembling the prototype. Additionally, I will need to research more about control systems and how to integrate equations into my controller.</p>
